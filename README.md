# StudioSpace 🎬 Studio & Production Space Sharing Marketplace

**StudioSpace** is a high-performance peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace platform designed for content creators, photographers, filmmakers, podcasters, and musicians. Studio owners and hosts can list creative workspaces—ranging from cyclorama wall photography studios and cinema sound stages to acoustic podcast lounges, vocal recording suites, and art workshops. Creators can easily search, inspect dynamic hourly specifications, check availability with overlap protection, and reserve studio slots with transparent pricing and real-time booking management.

## ✨ Key Features & Highlights

1. **P2P Workspace Marketplace & Category Filtering:** Search, filter, and inspect studios across specialized production categories (`Photo Studios`, `Sound Stages`, `Podcast Lounges`, `Music Suites`, `Art Workshops`) with real-time query support.
2. **Double-Booking Collision Prevention (Challenge #2):** Smart MongoDB server-side validation algorithm that automatically prevents dynamic hourly slot overlaps for active `Confirmed` or `Pending` reservations.
3. **Secure Auth with HTTPOnly JWT Cookies (Challenge #1):** Full authentication system supporting email/password registration with strict validation rules ($\ge 6$ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase), Google OAuth, and secure token storage in HTTPOnly Cookies.
4. **Host Management & Full CRUD Operations:** Dynamic studio listing management allows studio owners to add, update, and delete their spaces using image upload links (ImgBB/Postimage) and custom modal confirmations.
5. **Interactive UI & Custom Toast Engine:** Completely responsive layout built with glassmorphism aesthetics, interactive hero carousels, custom branded skeleton loaders, dark/light theme switcher (Challenge #3), custom 404 page, and zero native browser alerts (powered by Sonner/React Hot Toast).
